# 2A-Hashtable analysis

Unlike programming projects, this repo does not have any `tests` infrastructure.

## To Compile/Run
1.  You will need to provide the `main.cpp` and `hashtable.h` source.  We
    suggest starting with your files from the 2P-Hashtable programming project.
2. `cmake . -B build` (on Windows native, use `cmake . -B build -G "MinGW Makefiles"`)
3. `cd build`
4. `make` (on Windows native, use `mingw32-make`) 
5. `./run-main`
